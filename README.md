# Lending Club Case Study
## Objective of Study.
The primary cause of financial loss in lending comes from granting loans to applicants with higher risk profiles, resulting in what's known as credit loss. Credit loss is the monetary amount a lender loses when borrowers fail to repay their loans or abscond with the money they owe.

The primary goal is to identify these high-risk loan applicants, allowing for a reduction in such loans and a consequent decrease in credit loss. The focus of this case study is on using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to pinpoint these risky applicants.

Conducting an analysis is essential to uncover the key factors (or influential variables) behind loan defaults, i.e., the variables that strongly indicate the likelihood of a borrower defaulting. The company can leverage this knowledge to enhance its portfolio management and risk assessment processes.
